The Blood Alchemy website has been deleted. I'm going to explain a bit more as the post goes on but TL;DR if you don't have much time: I feel like I burned out my passion for the project. Blood Alchemy for me has always been a personal project, and not a commercial endeavour, yet I treated it as such with the ads, and many updates. I felt burned out, and with almost no one helping me, I wasted all my passion on it.

I won't say that I hated everything about working on it. It was really fun seeing the community grow, and adding new features. What I hated though was the shackles of responsibility I had. I know many people talked about overworking yourself, and I am not going to repeat it here, but this is a really important part of my reasoning to delete Blood Alchemy. I placed all of my responsibility about doing Blood Alchemy, as if I don't I'll be mocked. While I know it's not true, it really hurts. Especially that I mostly work alone and Itz doesn't really help, places tons of pressure on me.

So what now? I don't know. If anyone is willing to continue Blood Alchemy, go ahead, even with implementing ads for your own revenue, I really don't care. I might create another discord bot for Blood Alchemy, though I already moved on from Elemental 3.

So long, Blood Alchemy.
