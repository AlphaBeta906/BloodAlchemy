This is Blood Alchemy, the sucessor to Elementals 3. I finally feel like a pro, only after like 2 weeks. This repository has a REFI (React-Firebase) site that is pretty (very) buggy and a Python API just because I can't rewrite code from Python to JavaScript.

## FAQ

### How do I run this?
Firstly, (of course) get all the files. You will need ALL OF THEM. (like 90% is useful)

Then, ask me on the contact page my email, then and only then I will give you the code for the tokens. Then do `npm start` on my-app to pop up this abomination.

**Note: By running this, and getting the tokens, you would agree that I will use your code for my website (if it takes off).**

### Sweet! It is working now. By the way, when is the real thing gonna emerge.
It did! The website is at https://alphabeta906.github.io/BloodAlchemy

### Can I be part of the development?
No. Atleast not yet. If you want to help and me not paying you; you need to be good at React. If you want to get paid. Wait for a few months before the bread is earned.
