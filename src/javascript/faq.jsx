                <p class="text-xl">What is this 'Blood Alchemy'?</p>
                Blood Alchemy is a game where you can create elements and combine them to create new ones. Originally this was a Discord bot, but I decided to make it a website instead.<br /><br />

                <p class="text-xl">I heard this game before...</p>
                Yes, this is a game based on another game (Elemental 3) based on Doodle God.<br /><br />

                <p class="text-xl">COPPA?</p>
                No, we are legally outside of COPPA's juristriction, and we hate it so very much. We pledge to not add cookies nor trackers to the game.<br /><br />

                <p class="text-xl">I saw a bad word in this site! Please remove it!</p>
                We are not responsible for any bad words in the game, since this a community driven project. I am afraid we can't do anything about it.<br /><br />

                <p class="text-xl">I want to talk to your manager!</p>
                Take a chill pill. Go to the contact page, idiot.<br /><br />
