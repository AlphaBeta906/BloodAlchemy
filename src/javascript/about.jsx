      <center><h2>What is 'Blood Alchemy'?</h2></center>
      Blood Alchemy is an alchemy game where you combine elements to create new ones. Before it was a Discord bot, but now it's a website.

      <center><h2>How do I play?</h2></center>
      You can play the game by clicking the 'Play' button on the home page, or use www.elementals4.com/play.

      <center><h2>How do I create an account?</h2></center>
      You can create an account by clicking the 'Register' button on the navbar, or use www.elementals4.com/register. Same thing for logging in.

      <center><h2>How do I create a new element?</h2></center>
      If you get a reaction that leads to no elements, you can create a proposal for that element. It is then up to the users to decide whether to accept or reject it, via voting.

      <center><h2>How do I vote on proposals?</h2></center>
      You can vote on proposals by clicking the 'Vote' button on the proposal page, which you can enter by clicking the 'Proposals' button on the navbar, or use www.elementals4.com/proposals.

      <center><h2>I heard that you store IP adresses, is that true?</h2></center>
      No, atleast not anymore.

      <center><h2>Do you support and enforce COPPA in Blood Alchemy?</h2></center>
      We do not support and especially hate COPPA. We do not enforce it, as we do not collect data of our users.

      <center><h2>I just saw my kid see a bad word on this site! Can you please remove it?</h2></center>
      Unfortunetly, no. We can't delete elements since it will collapse some part of the elemental tree, thus destroying months of history. All of our elements are created by users, and we can't delete them. Democracy is democracy, and we can't anger people.

      <center><h2>Any plans for atleast having moderators?</h2></center>
      We do not have any plans for having moderators, since it will essentially destroy a integral part of the game: free speech and the power of the people/community. Even if the community votes on it, elements are hard to track and even if we found a element that was bad, we would have to delete it, essentially destroying the history of the game. You can still vote on proposals, but you can't delete them.

      <center><h2>This mumbo-jumbo is getting politcal. Are you trying to create a model government?</h2></center>
      No. This is a proto-democratic anarchy, proto meaning that it doesn't have a government. This is a game, and also a community, but not a government.

      <center><h2>Your fonts look good, but did you manage to get their permission?</h2></center>
      These fonts are free-ware, so no, I did not.
      
      <center><h2>I am very angered and I would like to speak to you!</h2></center> 
      Hey, I'm sorry for what I have done, but please know that I don't know any legal things. I'm just a kid developer, not a lawyer. If you have any questions, email me <a href="mailto:dragonkingalyx@gmail.com">using this link</a>.
